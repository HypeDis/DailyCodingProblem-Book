# 1.3 maximum sub array sum

## Kadane's Algorithm

O(n) algorithm for determining maximum sum subArray.
max_Ending_here tracks the maximum value encountered so far
if current value is greater then max_ending_here + current value, it becomes the new starting point for max_ending_here.

For wrapping, the trick is that the maximum wrapped sum will be the sum of the array - the minimum sub array.

finding the max between the wrapping and non wrapping sub arrays will give us the absolute max.

# 1.4 find number of smaller elements to the right

## bisect

https://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html
allows insertion into sorted array without messing up the order

bisect_left(array, value) returns the index at which the value would go
bisect.insort(array, val) inserts the value in to the array
