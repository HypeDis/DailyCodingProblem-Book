## 2.1 Find Anagram Indices

using hash maps is very useful when dealing with strings

sliding window

# 2.2 generate palindrome pairs

create a dictionary of words(key) and indexes(value)
generate possible prefix and suffix palindromes and check if they exist in the dictionary.
basically finding the pivot points in each word that are symmetrical and mirroring the left over chars
example:
'gaba'

starting from the back, so that the original word is in front.
'a' is symmetrical so 'gaba' + 'bag' is the palindrome
'ab' is not symmetrical, skip
'aba' is symmetrical so 'gaba' + 'g' is the palindrome
'abag' is not a palindrome, skip

from the front
'' is symmetrical so 'abag' + 'gaba'
'g' is symmetrical so 'aba' + 'gaba'
'ga' is not symmetrical
'gab' is not symmetrical
'gaba' is not symmetrical

2.4
the phsyical description of a problem is not usually the best way to code it. 

key to this problem is understanding that k > 1 allows you to swap any two values, meaning you can completely sort the array. (nlogn)

k == 1 means we have to rotate the first char and compare all the mutations to get the minimum. 
O(n) for traversal and O(n) for comparison each step  = O(n^2)
